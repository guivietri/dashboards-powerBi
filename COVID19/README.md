**-----First project in Power BI-----**

Made to practice and improve the knowledge I acquired in Power BI as well as data processing and analysis.

[DASHBOARD COVID 19](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDk0MzFmMGItYTVjNy00MGNlLWIxMWEtZjkxN2FhM2FhOWYzIiwidCI6ImNjZTU5NGI0LTI2NTEtNDQwMC04MjUwLWMxNDUyOTFlZDgzMyJ9)

Dashboard on covid-19 because I thought would have a large amount of data to work with, as the sources actually do. The files got too big (250mb even .csv files) and I didn't feel the need to upload them here.

All data used are public and are cited at the bottom of the dashboard.

Included a small python script I made to handle some .csv files.
